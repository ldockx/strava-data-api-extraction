# 🏃‍♂️ Bruges Marathon Data Exploration

A while ago I ran my very first marathon — the Bruges Marathon. Beautiful city, amazing vibe… and a very solid encounter with “the wall.”
The first half felt great, the second half… well, let’s just say gravity won.

This repo is my way of figuring out why.

## 🎯 What this repo is about

Using the Strava API, I pulled all available data from my marathon activity:

Event data (pace, distance, heart rate, etc.)

Stream data (the juicy, point-by-point stuff)

With that, I did a small analysis to understand how the race unfolded and where things went sideways. I also generated an HTML map of the full route, which makes the whole thing feel a bit more real.

## 🛠️ Why I built it

Besides wanting to understand my own race, this project is also the foundation for my next one:
a marathon time predictor.

To build that model, I needed clean, structured running data — and who better to start with than myself?

## 📦 What you’ll find here

Scripts to fetch data from the Strava API

Preprocessed marathon data

A simple analysis of the run

An interactive route map

A small step in the direction of future PRs
