# My Marathon Journey & Strava Data Analysis

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, healthy lifestyles have become increasingly popular in my age group. Strava, for many, has evolved more into a social media platform for showcasing achievements than a tool for tracking progress. (Well, maybe that was Strava's plan all along—well played, Strava.)

I, too, followed this trend. I started running a lot during lockdowns—not just to get fitter, but also to pass the time. Over time, however, I began to feel a sense of dissatisfaction. Sure, I could run, but for what purpose? What was my real goal?

Last year, I decided to take on a challenge: running a marathon. And last month, I did it—completing the Bruges Marathon, something that seemed impossible five years ago (especially considering I was probably the least sporty person you’d meet). It wasn’t easy. I didn’t hit my goal of finishing under four hours, and the second half was the toughest battle I’ve ever faced—but I did it.

As a data enthusiast, I naturally became curious about the numbers behind my performance. Using my Garmin sports watch, which automatically syncs with Strava, I was able to extract my running data through the Strava API for analysis.

The goal of this project is to explore that data through interesting visualizations and insights. I’ve also framed it as a story, because in my humble opinion, the greatest skill of a data scientist is turning raw data into narratives people can understand and enjoy.

So buckle up—let’s take a run through my marathon journey, data-style.
